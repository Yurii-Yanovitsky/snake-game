## How to Play

- Press `Space` to start or pause the game.
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- The snake grows each time it eats the loot (yellow block).

## Technologies

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering game graphics.
